# esr_plot

Visualize ESR data with PGFPlots & TikZ.

## Compilation

Compile the document ``main.tex`` with XeLaTeX using MikTeX. When visualizing many line plots it may be necessary to 
expand the main memory size with the additional compiler argument ``--extra-mem-top=100000000``.

## Experimental & Simulated Data

This work contains example ESR data acquired during a practical as well as data simulated with the MatLab software 
package EasySpin. Both are located in the directory ``data``. Complementary kinetic EPR data can be found in the 
repository [``kepr_plot``](https://github.com/Rastow/kepr_plot).
